    "# Build a Customer Support Router Agentic RAG System\n",

    "In this project, we will leverage the power of AI Agents and RAG Systems to build an intelligent Router Agentic RAG System to handle customer support queries using a custom knowledgebase.\n",

    "### Intelligent Router Agentic RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building an **Intelligent Router Agentic RAG System** that combines intelligent query analysis, sentiment detection, and dynamic routing with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle diverse user inquiries efficiently. The workflow includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Categorization and Sentiment Analysis**:\n",
    "   - The system uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** to analyze the user's query and determine:\n",
    "     - **Query Category**: Identifies the type of problem, such as billing, technical issues, or general queries.\n",
    "     - **User Sentiment**: Evaluates the user's sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) to determine if escalation is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intelligent Routing**:\n",
    "   - Based on the **query_category** and **query_sentiment**, the system routes the query to the appropriate handling node:\n",
    "     - **Escalate to Human**: If the sentiment is negative, the query is escalated to a human for resolution.\n",
    "     - **Generate Billing Response**: Queries related to billing are routed to generate an appropriate response.\n",
    "     - **Generate Technical Response**: Technical queries are routed for a specialized technical response.\n",
    "     - **Generate General Response**: General queries are handled with context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Knowledge Base Integration (RAG)**:\n",
    "   - The system integrates with a **Knowledge Base (Vector Database)** to augment responses with relevant and accurate information.\n",
    "   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures that responses are grounded in the latest and most reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Escalation Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - Negative sentiment triggers an **escalation to a human**, ensuring the user receives empathetic and personalized support for critical issues.\n"
